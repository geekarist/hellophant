# hellophant

This is a small (failed) experiment to call Clojure code from an Android app.

Here are some notes:

Develop an Android app in Clojure using https://clojurephant.dev/clojurephant/

Installed `clj` PowerShell command with an alias to use it from Bash

Created a project in Android Studio (empty Activity)

Installed the Cursive plugin in Android Studio

Created a `Hello` class in Java which calls the `hello` Clojure function â‡’ error: "Cannot resolve symbol 'String'"

That's it.
